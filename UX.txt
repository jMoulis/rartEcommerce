Billing Address:
To avoid disrupting users, it’s key to ensure the following when it comes to implementing billing address fields:

Set the billing address to equal the shipping address by default
Use a preticked checkbox for “Billing = Shipping” and hide the billing address fields
Ask users to fill out the shipping address fields instead of the billing address fields
Summarize the entered shipping address when displaying the “Billing = Shipping” checkbox
